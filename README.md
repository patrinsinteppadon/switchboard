## Switchboard
### Women in Tech resource
#### January 2019 

Hackathon mockup of a [website](https://mhvan98.wixsite.com/winfo2019) that acts as a resource for women in tech to connect with other women to get anonymous one-to-one advice on issues encountered within a male-dominated industry.

The name "Switchboard" was chosen as a reference to the switchboard that telephone operators, who were primarily women, would use to establish telephone calls between users.  In the same way this resource seeks to connect individuals with others who can provide guidance and mentorship.
